## ðŸš€ Development Guide

### **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (optional)

Check your setup:

```sh
node -v && npm -v && git --version
```

### **Clone the Repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/01-LinYi/PurePost-frontend.git
cd PurePost-frontend
```

### **Install Dependencies**

Using npm:

```sh
npm install
```

Or using Yarn:

```sh
yarn install
```

### **Environment Variables**

Copy the .env.example file to `.env` and update the values as needed:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Currently this `.env` file is not used and you have to manually configure the backend URL in file `constants/Api.ts`

### **Running the Application**

To start the development server, run:

```sh
npm start
```

Or using Yarn:

```sh
yarn start
```

This will start the Expo development server. Following the instruction on CLI, you can use the Expo Go app on your mobile device to scan the QR code and run the application.

The below options for compling a CNG build and run the app on your local simulators.

### **Running on Android**

```sh
npm run android
```

Or using Yarn:

```sh
yarn android
```

### **Running on iOS**

```sh
npm run ios
```

Or using Yarn:

```

### **Building the Application**

```sh
npm run build
```

Or using Yarn:

```sh
yarn build
```

This will create a production build of the application.

### **Contributing**

#### Branching and Workflow

- **The main branch** contains the stable code. Avoid directly pushing breaking changes to main.
- **Create Feature Branches**:

  - Use a descriptive branch name, e.g., feature/add-login, fix/navbar-bug.
  - Branch from main:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name main
  ```

### Continuous Integration (CI)

This project uses GitHub Actions to automate the Continuous Integration (CI) process, ensuring code quality through automated builds and tests. The CI pipeline is configured to run on every push and pull request to the main branch.
